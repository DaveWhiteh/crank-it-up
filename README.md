## About

Crank-it Up is a full-stack ecommerce website that allows users to purchase quality used bikes. The user can browse either by all bikes or can choose a category that will take them to specific bikes. As the bikes are either custom or used no quantities will be necessary as these are one-off bikes to be purchased. The bikes on the product page can be sorted via price, name or category. Users will be able to add products to their basket and checkout securely using Stripe. Users will be able to register for an account and perform full CRUD functionality on their personal details and will also be able to see their purchase history.

The site will be targeted towards individuals who want a no nonsense, quick and easy way to purchase used quality bikes.
